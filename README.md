# [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/python/) Exploration

This is a repository that contains the code of our microbit exploration project.

## Who

Developed by Rowan, Jad, Atlas, and Kouya

## What

We made a robot that, using images, would indicate if it was level or not, and if not, in what direction it was tilted in.

## How

We used the micro:bit accelerometer to detect whenever the robot rotated too far from being level and then show an image to tell us in what direction.

## Why  !!

We made the design choices we made because... (why did you do what you did? what did you try first? what did you learn?)
